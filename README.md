# simple-calculator-v2
A simple android calculator created in collaboration with the UI design of [Andrea Chiara De Santis](https://www.behance.net/andydesa) and the power of the [EvalEx](https://github.com/uklimaschewski/EvalEx) library created by [Udo Klimaschewski](https://github.com/uklimaschewski)

* Made in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* Designed Using [ConstraintLayouts](https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout/) to support any form factor
* App has an [Adaptive Launcher Icon](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_adaptive)
* Looks awesome in Montserrat thanks to [Downloadable Fonts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/downloadable-fonts)
* The expression result grows based on space thanks to [Autosizing TextViews](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/autosizing-textview)
* Using [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) to communicate updates in the [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to the UI through [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/)
